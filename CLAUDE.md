This is a project to resuscitate GitX.

* [x] make it compile
* [x] replace objective-git with git exec
* [ ] debug obvious issues (visual, functional)

The last commit before starting surgery was ce17d079d2563baf5c54ed6c49d6dcc05deffad4.

When launching GitX for testing purposes, recompile it, and then launch with the added flag `--git-dir=/Users/josh/j/bold`.
This opens GitX with the bold repository pre-loaded for testing.
