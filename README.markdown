pieter made a nice, simple git gui for macOS. rowanj made it better. I thank both of them.

Then it languished. Some other people added features, which I mostly felt indifferent to. Eventually, it bitrotted so much that it no longer compiled.

I carried around an old binary and would install Rosetta on each new machine so I could still use it.

Then coding agents happened.

I had a coding agent bring it back to life for me. In the process I stripped out a bunch of features that I don't personally use.

This fork is for me. Almost all of the code changes are vibe-coded. I have made no attempt at beautiful code, nice commit messages, any of that.

The features I care about work reasonably well. The UI aspects I care about are intact. The bugs I care about get fixed. The rest...who knows?
